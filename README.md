# Cipher Core (CIPHC) Project

## Introduction
Provide a next generation evolutionary cash platform that can issue crypto token/coin which is regarded as the historical final form.

## Why?
Ever since the Internet was opened to private sectors in the 1990s, commercial transactions on the Internet have grown explosively and have changed the traditional business custom fundamentally. And the world has dreamed of creating cash that can be used safely on the Internet.
An experimental attempt to use the ledger in 2009 has been shown to the world. This is Bitcoin using a block chain. Although Bitcoin demonstrated new ideas such as double trading prevention and consensus building of all participants in the community, it has already begun to cause many problems due to structural vulnerability and limitations.

## What is?
Provide a crypto cash platform by applying crypto cash technology which was designed originally for issuing legal tenders. Now, all issued (and will be issued) tokens /coins will be able to be evolved to crypto cash which will be the final form of historical currency by shifting to this new platform. Anybody in any community can issue any crypto cash that can be used on the Internet that does not require huge amounts of communication traffic or electricity, can be instantly settled and can be saved.

## What we can
* CIPHER CORE evolves to the first crypto cash, CIPHER CORE CASH on the CIPHER CORE Platform.
* And, all tokens/coins evolve to crypto cashes, Token/Coin CASH on the CIPHER CORE Platform.

## Our Product
### Crypto Cash Platform
The collapse of the token/coin platform using a block chain has already begun, and the provision of an alternative platform is awaited. Traditional block chain type token/coin platform has been subjected to repeated improvements, but it is known that structural defects cannot be overcome, and what is drawing attention as the most promising candidate that can solve this problem fundamentally is a Crypto Cash Platform based on crypto cash technology.

### Reference1:u-VKS
The key encryption technology developed by NTI Group can solve the long-recognized issues of shared key exchange risk and encryption algorithm vulnerability. Even if devices such as quantum computers which can perform higher dimension calculations are used, it is possible to create generally unbreakable algorithms and safely share keys used for decryption.

## Reference2:Crypto Cash
"Crypto Cash", the world's first crypto cash, is a currency that uses a symbol strings as a pseudo tangible material (or entity) as a substitute to be exchanged when exchanging value, and as the cryptographic technology is completed, it was developed for the first time in the world as basic technology to issue legal tenders. Information of issuers and value of cash is uniquely associated with completely encrypted symbol strings, and this fact makes tampering, counterfeiting, false use impossible. By encrypting conditions such as credit information, usage conditions, interests, deadlines, crypto cash with various functions can be created. Since it is easy to send / save electronically, it can be issued as crypto metal money or crypto banknotes if it is engraved on metal or printed on papers because it does not matter about the recording medium.
